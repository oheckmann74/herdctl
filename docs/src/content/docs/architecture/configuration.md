title: Configuration System
description: How herdctl discovers, parses, validates, and resolves fleet and agent configuration — including YAML parsing, Zod schemas, environment interpolation, default merging, fleet composition, and hot reload
---

The configuration system is the first thing that runs when herdctl starts. It discovers the `herdctl.yaml` fleet configuration file, parses YAML, validates against Zod schemas, interpolates environment variables, loads all referenced agent files, merges defaults, and (for composed fleets) recursively loads sub-fleet configurations. The result is a single `ResolvedConfig` object that every other subsystem consumes.

All configuration logic lives in `packages/core/src/config/`. The module is structured as follows:

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `schema.ts` | Zod schemas for fleet config, agent config, fleet references, schedules, permissions, Docker, chat, hooks |
| `loader.ts` | Config discovery, recursive fleet loading, agent loading, qualified name computation |
| `merge.ts` | Deep merge utilities, fleet defaults into agent configs |
| `interpolate.ts` | Environment variable interpolation (`${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}`) |
| `parser.ts` | Lower-level YAML parsing functions, error classes |
| `index.ts` | Public exports |

## Config Discovery

When `loadConfig()` is called without an explicit path, it searches for a configuration file by walking up the directory tree from the current working directory -- the same pattern git uses to find `.git/`. The search checks for both `herdctl.yaml` and `herdctl.yml` at each level.

```typescript
// Auto-discover from current working directory
const config = await loadConfig();

// Load from a specific file
const config = await loadConfig("./my-project/herdctl.yaml");

// Load from a specific directory (searches within it)
const config = await loadConfig("./my-project");
```

The discovery algorithm:

1. Start from the given directory (or `process.cwd()` if none provided).
2. At each directory, check for `herdctl.yaml` then `herdctl.yml`.
3. If found, return the absolute path.
4. Move to the parent directory. If the parent equals the current directory (filesystem root reached), throw `ConfigNotFoundError`.

If a path ending in `.yaml` or `.yml` is provided, it is treated as a direct file path with no directory walking.

## Loading Pipeline

The full loading pipeline runs through these stages in order:

1. **Discovery** -- Find the config file on disk (or use the provided path).
2. **Dotenv loading** -- Load a `.env` file from the config file's directory if one exists. System environment variables take precedence over `.env` values.
3. **YAML parsing** -- Parse the fleet config file with the `yaml` package.
4. **Backward compatibility** -- Migrate deprecated field names (e.g., `workspace` to `working_directory`).
5. **Zod validation** -- Validate the parsed object against `FleetConfigSchema`.
6. **Environment interpolation** -- Replace `${VAR}` patterns in all string values throughout the config tree.
7. **Path normalization** -- Resolve relative paths in `working_directory` and `defaults.working_directory` relative to the config file's directory.
8. **Agent loading** -- For each entry in the `agents` array, read the agent YAML file, parse, validate, interpolate, merge fleet defaults, and resolve paths.
9. **Sub-fleet loading** -- For each entry in the `fleets` array, recursively load the sub-fleet config, resolve its agents, and flatten everything into a single agent list. See [Fleet Composition](#fleet-composition) below.
10. **Return** -- Return a `ResolvedConfig` containing the fleet config, the flat list of `ResolvedAgent` objects, and metadata.

```typescript
export interface ResolvedConfig {
  fleet: FleetConfig;          // The parsed and validated fleet configuration
  agents: ResolvedAgent[];     // All agents, fully resolved with defaults merged
  configPath: string;          // Absolute path to the fleet configuration file
  configDir: string;           // Directory containing the fleet configuration
}
```

## Schema Overview

All schemas are defined with [Zod](https://zod.dev/) and provide both runtime validation and TypeScript type inference. Every exported type is derived from its schema using `z.infer<>`.

### FleetConfigSchema

The top-level schema for `herdctl.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1

fleet:
  name: my-fleet
  description: "Optional description"

defaults:
  model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  permission_mode: acceptEdits
  allowed_tools: [Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep]
  work_source:
    type: github
    repo: owner/repo
  docker:
    enabled: false
  session:
    max_turns: 50

working_directory:
  root: ~/herdctl-workspace
  auto_clone: true

fleets:
  - path: ./project-a/herdctl.yaml
  - path: ./project-b/herdctl.yaml
    name: project-b-override

agents:
  - path: ./agents/security-auditor.yaml
  - path: ./agents/engineer.yaml
    overrides:
      model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514

web:
  enabled: true
  port: 3232

webhooks:
  enabled: false
  port: 8081
```

Key schema fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | `number` | Schema version (default: 1) |
| `fleet` | `object` | Fleet metadata: `name` and `description` |
| `defaults` | `DefaultsSchema` | Default values merged into every agent |
| `working_directory` | `WorkingDirectorySchema` | Workspace root, auto-clone settings |
| `fleets` | `FleetReferenceSchema[]` | Sub-fleet references for fleet composition |
| `agents` | `AgentReferenceSchema[]` | Agent file references |
| `web` | `WebSchema` | Web dashboard settings |
| `webhooks` | `WebhooksSchema` | Webhook receiver settings |
| `docker` | `FleetDockerSchema` | Fleet-level Docker defaults |
| `chat` | `ChatSchema` | Fleet-level chat settings |

The schema uses Zod's `.strict()` mode, which rejects unknown fields. This catches typos and invalid field names at startup rather than silently ignoring them.

### AgentConfigSchema

Each agent is defined in its own YAML file:

```yaml
name: security-auditor
description: "Runs security audits on pull requests"

working_directory: ~/herdctl-workspace/my-project
repo: owner/my-project

model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
max_turns: 100
permission_mode: acceptEdits
runtime: sdk

identity:
  name: Security Auditor
  role: security reviewer

system_prompt: |
  You are a security auditor. Review code for vulnerabilities.

allowed_tools:
  - Read
  - Glob
  - Grep
  - Bash

work_source:
  type: github
  repo: owner/my-project
  labels:
    ready: needs-security-review

schedules:
  audit:
    type: interval
    interval: "30m"
    prompt: "Check for issues needing security review."

session:
  max_turns: 50
  timeout: "30m"

mcp_servers:
  github:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}

chat:
  discord:
    bot_token_env: AUDITOR_DISCORD_TOKEN
    guilds:
      - id: "123456789"
        channels:
          - id: "987654321"
            mode: mention

hooks:
  after_run:
    - type: discord
      channel_id: "111222333"
      bot_token_env: NOTIFY_DISCORD_TOKEN

docker:
  enabled: true
  memory: 2g
```

Agent names must match the pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$` -- alphanumeric start, then letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. Dots are explicitly forbidden because they serve as the hierarchy separator in qualified names (see [Qualified Names](#qualified-names)).

### Agent References

Each entry in the fleet's `agents` array is an `AgentReferenceSchema` with a required `path` and optional `overrides`:

```yaml
agents:
  - path: ./agents/engineer.yaml
  - path: ./agents/auditor.yaml
    overrides:
      model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
      max_turns: 200
```

The `overrides` field accepts any partial agent config fields and is deep-merged on top of the agent's own configuration after fleet defaults are applied.

### Fleet References

Each entry in the `fleets` array is a `FleetReferenceSchema`:

```yaml
fleets:
  - path: ./herdctl/herdctl.yaml
    name: herdctl
    overrides:
      web:
        enabled: false
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `path` | `string` | Path to a sub-fleet YAML file (relative to parent) |
| `name` | `string?` | Override the sub-fleet's name in the hierarchy |
| `overrides` | `Record<string, unknown>?` | Top-level config overrides applied to the sub-fleet |

## Default Merging

Fleet-level defaults reduce repetition across agent configurations. The `defaults` section in `herdctl.yaml` specifies values that apply to every agent unless the agent overrides them.

### Mergeable Fields

The following fields from `defaults` are merged into agent configs:

| Field | Merge Strategy |
|-------|---------------|
| `work_source` | Deep merge (nested objects merged recursively) |
| `session` | Deep merge |
| `docker` | Deep merge |
| `instances` | Deep merge |
| `working_directory` | Agent takes precedence; if both are objects, deep merge |
| `model` | Agent value wins if defined; otherwise default fills in |
| `max_turns` | Agent value wins if defined; otherwise default fills in |
| `permission_mode` | Agent value wins if defined; otherwise default fills in |
| `allowed_tools` | Agent array replaces default entirely (arrays are not merged) |
| `denied_tools` | Agent array replaces default entirely |

### Deep Merge Semantics

The `deepMerge()` function follows these rules:

- **Objects**: Recursively merged. Keys from both sides are included. Where keys overlap, the override value wins (or is recursively merged if both values are objects).
- **Arrays**: Replaced entirely. The agent's array replaces the default's array with no element-level merging.
- **Scalars** (strings, numbers, booleans): The override value replaces the base value.
- **Undefined**: If the override value is `undefined`, the base value is preserved.

This means an agent that specifies `allowed_tools: [Read, Glob]` completely replaces any `allowed_tools` from defaults -- it does not append to the default list.

### Example

```yaml
# herdctl.yaml
defaults:
  model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  permission_mode: acceptEdits
  allowed_tools: [Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep]
  work_source:
    type: github
    labels:
      ready: ready
```

```yaml
# agents/engineer.yaml
name: engineer
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514       # overrides default model
work_source:
  type: github
  repo: owner/my-project    # merged with default work_source
  # labels.ready inherited from defaults as "ready"
# permission_mode inherited from defaults as "acceptEdits"
# allowed_tools inherited from defaults
```

The resolved agent config will have `model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (from agent), `permission_mode: acceptEdits` (from defaults), `allowed_tools: [Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep]` (from defaults), and a `work_source` with both `type`, `repo`, and `labels.ready` populated (deep merge of defaults and agent).

## Environment Variable Interpolation

String values anywhere in the configuration tree can reference environment variables using `${VAR}` syntax. The interpolation engine walks the entire config object recursively, processing only string values and leaving numbers, booleans, and other types untouched.

### Syntax

| Pattern | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `${VAR_NAME}` | Replace with the value of `VAR_NAME` from the environment. Throws `UndefinedVariableError` if the variable is not defined. |
| `${VAR_NAME:-default}` | Replace with the value of `VAR_NAME`, or `default` if the variable is not defined. |

Variable names must match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*` (standard shell variable naming).

### Example

```yaml
work_source:
  type: github
  repo: ${GITHUB_REPO}
  auth:
    token_env: ${GITHUB_TOKEN_ENV:-GITHUB_TOKEN}

chat:
  discord:
    bot_token_env: ${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_VAR}
```

### Dotenv Support

The loader automatically looks for a `.env` file in the same directory as the `herdctl.yaml` file. If found, its variables are loaded into the interpolation environment. Existing system environment variables take precedence over `.env` values -- the `.env` file fills in gaps rather than overriding.

The `envFile` option on `loadConfig()` controls this behavior:

- `true` (default): Auto-load `.env` from the config directory if it exists.
- `false`: Do not load any `.env` file.
- A string path: Load a specific `.env` file.

### Interpolation Ordering

Interpolation runs after YAML parsing but before Zod validation. This means the raw YAML is first parsed into a JavaScript object, then all `${VAR}` patterns in string values are replaced, and only then is the result validated against the schema. This ordering allows validation to catch issues introduced by incorrect environment variable values (e.g., an interpolated string that does not match a required pattern).

## Agent File Resolution

Agent paths in the `agents` array are resolved relative to the fleet config file's directory, not the current working directory. This means the same fleet config works regardless of where `herdctl start` is invoked.

```yaml
# If herdctl.yaml is at /home/user/fleet/herdctl.yaml
agents:
  - path: ./agents/engineer.yaml        # resolves to /home/user/fleet/agents/engineer.yaml
  - path: ../shared/auditor.yaml         # resolves to /home/user/shared/auditor.yaml
  - path: /absolute/path/agent.yaml      # used as-is
```

Within each agent, `working_directory` is resolved relative to the agent config file's directory. If the agent does not specify a `working_directory`, it defaults to the directory containing the agent YAML file.

## Fleet Composition

Fleet composition allows multiple fleet configurations to be combined into a single unified fleet. A root fleet can reference sub-fleets, and sub-fleets can reference their own sub-fleets, forming a tree of arbitrary depth. At runtime, the entire tree is flattened into a single list of agents with metadata about their position in the hierarchy.

<img src="/diagrams/fleet-composition.svg" alt="Fleet composition diagram showing a root fleet referencing two sub-fleets, each with their own agents, all flattened into a single agent list at runtime" width="100%" />

### Why Fleet Composition Exists

Real engineering organizations manage multiple projects, each with their own agents. Fleet composition mirrors this structure: define agents per-project in their own `herdctl.yaml`, then compose them into a single super-fleet that one instance of herdctl manages.

### Schema

A fleet config can have both `fleets` (sub-fleet references) and `agents` (direct agent references), or either one alone:

```yaml
# Root fleet: composes two project fleets plus a global monitor agent
version: 1
fleet:
  name: all-projects

web:
  enabled: true
  port: 3232

fleets:
  - path: ./herdctl/herdctl.yaml
    name: herdctl
    overrides:
      web:
        enabled: false
  - path: ./other-project/herdctl.yaml
    overrides:
      web:
        enabled: false

agents:
  - path: ./global-agents/monitor.yaml
```

Each sub-fleet YAML is itself a valid standalone fleet config. It parses through `FleetConfigSchema` independently, which means sub-fleets can be used standalone or composed into a larger fleet.

### Recursive Loading

The `loadConfig()` function handles fleet composition internally. When it encounters a `fleets` array, it recursively loads each referenced fleet config, resolves its agents, and appends them to the flat output list. The algorithm:

1. Parse and validate the root fleet config.
2. Load root-level agents (these get `fleetPath: []`).
3. For each entry in `fleets`:
   a. Resolve the path relative to the current config's directory.
   b. Check the visited-paths set for cycles (see [Cycle Detection](#cycle-detection)).
   c. Read and parse the sub-fleet YAML.
   d. Resolve the sub-fleet's name (see [Fleet Naming](#fleet-naming)).
   e. Validate no name collision at this level.
   f. Apply fleet-level overrides from the parent.
   g. Suppress sub-fleet web config by default.
   h. Compute effective defaults for the sub-fleet's agents.
   i. Load all agents from the sub-fleet with the computed `fleetPath`.
   j. Recurse into the sub-fleet's own `fleets` array.
4. Return the full flat agent list.

The public API signature of `loadConfig()` is unchanged -- callers receive a flat `ResolvedConfig` regardless of whether fleet composition is used. The hierarchy is a config-loading concern, not a runtime concern.

### Qualified Names

Every agent receives a computed `qualifiedName` that encodes its position in the fleet hierarchy. The qualified name is a dot-separated path formed from the fleet hierarchy segments followed by the agent's local name:

| Fleet Path | Agent Name | Qualified Name |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| `[]` (root) | `monitor` | `monitor` |
| `["herdctl"]` | `security-auditor` | `herdctl.security-auditor` |
| `["herdctl"]` | `engineer` | `herdctl.engineer` |
| `["other-project"]` | `security-auditor` | `other-project.security-auditor` |
| `["other-project", "frontend"]` | `designer` | `other-project.frontend.designer` |

Key rules:

- The root fleet's name is **not** included in qualified names. There is only one root, so including it would add noise without disambiguation value.
- Agents directly on the root fleet have `qualifiedName === name`. Single-fleet setups (no `fleets` array) are completely unaffected.
- The dot separator is unambiguous because agent and fleet names cannot contain dots (enforced by `AGENT_NAME_PATTERN`).

The `qualifiedName` is the primary key used throughout the runtime: scheduler lookups, job creation, state persistence, API routes, WebSocket subscriptions, event payloads, and log output.

```typescript
export interface ResolvedAgent extends AgentConfig {
  configPath: string;       // Absolute path to agent config file
  fleetPath: string[];      // Fleet hierarchy: ["herdctl"] or []
  qualifiedName: string;    // Computed: "herdctl.security-auditor" or "monitor"
}
```

### Fleet Naming

Sub-fleets need names to form qualified agent names. The name is resolved using a priority order:

1. **Parent's explicit `name`** on the fleet reference (highest priority).
2. **Sub-fleet's own `fleet.name`** from its config.
3. **Directory name** derived from the sub-fleet config file's parent directory (fallback).

Fleet names must pass the same validation pattern as agent names (`^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`). This ensures dots remain reserved as the hierarchy separator.

### Sub-fleet Hierarchy in the Web UI

<img src="/diagrams/fleet-composition-subteams.svg" alt="Fleet composition with sub-teams showing hierarchical agent grouping in the sidebar" width="100%" />

The web dashboard sidebar groups agents by their `fleetPath`, rendering sub-fleets as collapsible sections. Agents directly on the root appear ungrouped at the top level. Within each section, agents show their local `name` (not the full qualified name) alongside a status indicator.

### Defaults Merging Across Levels

When fleets are composed, defaults cascade through the hierarchy with a specific priority order. For an agent inside a sub-fleet, the merge order from lowest to highest priority is:

1. **Super-fleet `defaults`** -- Gap-filler. Provides values only where nothing else does.
2. **Sub-fleet `defaults`** -- The sub-fleet's own default values for its agents.
3. **Agent's own config** -- The agent's explicit values.
4. **Per-agent `overrides`** from the sub-fleet's `agents` entry.
5. **Per-fleet `overrides`** from the super-fleet's `fleets` entry (highest priority, but only fleet-level fields -- does not reach into individual agent configs).

This means a super-fleet's defaults fill gaps but do not forcefully override a sub-fleet's decisions. If the super-fleet needs to forcefully override something, it uses the `overrides` field on the fleet reference.

### Web Config Suppression

By default, only the root fleet's web configuration is honored. Sub-fleet web configurations are automatically suppressed (`web.enabled = false`) during recursive loading. This ensures a single web dashboard instance serves all agents across all nested fleets. If a parent fleet explicitly sets `web` in its `overrides` for a sub-fleet reference, that override is respected.

### Cycle Detection

The loader maintains a `visitedPaths: Set<string>` of absolute config file paths as it descends the fleet tree. Before loading any sub-fleet, it checks whether the resolved path has already been visited. If a cycle is detected, it throws `FleetCycleError` with the full path chain showing exactly where the cycle occurs:

```
Fleet composition cycle detected: /root.yaml -> /project-a/herdctl.yaml -> /shared/herdctl.yaml -> /project-a/herdctl.yaml
```

### Fleet Name Collisions

If two sub-fleets at the same level resolve to the same fleet name (after the naming resolution described above), the loader throws `FleetNameCollisionError` at startup with an actionable message:

```
Fleet name collision at level "herdctl": two sub-fleets resolve to name "project-a".
Conflicting references: ./project-a/herdctl.yaml, ./renamed-a/herdctl.yaml
Add explicit "name" overrides to disambiguate.
```

### Fleet-Level Overrides

Overrides on a fleet reference apply to top-level fields of the sub-fleet's config only (e.g., `web`, `defaults`, `webhooks`). A parent fleet cannot reach into individual agent configs within a sub-fleet through fleet-level overrides. If you need to override a specific agent's configuration, import that agent directly as an agent reference with overrides rather than as part of a sub-fleet.

### Agent Import

Importing a sub-fleet imports all of its agents. There is no selective agent import mechanism. If a fleet contains agents you do not need, restructure the fleet definitions or import agents individually.

## Config Reload

FleetManager supports hot-reloading configuration without restarting the fleet process. The `ConfigReload` module in `packages/core/src/fleet-manager/config-reload.ts` implements this:

1. Load and validate the new configuration (full recursive resolution for composed fleets).
2. If validation fails, keep the old configuration and re-throw the error. The fleet continues operating with the previous valid config.
3. Compute a diff between old and new configurations using `computeConfigChanges()`. The diff uses `qualifiedName` as the comparison key, so changes to agents in sub-fleets are correctly detected.
4. Update the stored configuration.
5. Update the scheduler with the new agent list.
6. Emit a `config:reloaded` event with the change summary.

Running jobs continue with their original configuration. Only new jobs use the reloaded configuration.

The `computeConfigChanges()` function produces a list of `ConfigChange` objects categorized as `added`, `removed`, or `modified` for both agents and schedules. Change names use qualified names (e.g., `herdctl.security-auditor` for an agent, `herdctl.security-auditor/audit` for a schedule).

The `reload()` method exists on FleetManager but is not triggered automatically. There is no file watcher or signal handler built in -- callers invoke `fleet.reload()` explicitly (e.g., from a CLI command or web UI action).

## Error Handling

The configuration system defines a typed error hierarchy rooted at `ConfigError`. Each error class includes contextual information for diagnosing the problem:

| Error Class | When Thrown |
|------------|------------|
| `ConfigError` | Base class for all configuration errors |
| `ConfigNotFoundError` | No `herdctl.yaml` found after walking up the directory tree |
| `YamlSyntaxError` | Invalid YAML syntax (includes line and column numbers) |
| `SchemaValidationError` | Zod schema validation failed (includes per-field issue details) |
| `FileReadError` | A config file could not be read from disk |
| `AgentLoadError` | An agent YAML file failed to load (wraps the underlying error) |
| `AgentValidationError` | Agent config failed Zod validation (includes file path) |
| `UndefinedVariableError` | `${VAR}` referenced an undefined variable with no default |
| `FleetCycleError` | Fleet composition cycle detected (includes full path chain) |
| `FleetNameCollisionError` | Two sub-fleets at the same level resolve to the same name |
| `InvalidFleetNameError` | A fleet name does not match the required identifier pattern |
| `FleetLoadError` | A sub-fleet YAML file failed to load (includes referencing file) |

All errors extend `ConfigError`, which extends the standard `Error` class. Consumers can use `instanceof` checks for error discrimination. The `safeLoadConfig()` function provides a non-throwing alternative that returns a result object:

```typescript
const result = await safeLoadConfig("./herdctl.yaml");
if (result.success) {
  const config = result.data;
} else {
  console.error(result.error.message);
}
```
