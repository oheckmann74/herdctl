title: State Persistence
description: How herdctl stores and manages fleet state on disk using file-based persistence
---

herdctl uses a file-based state system to track agents, jobs, and sessions. All persistent state is stored in the `.herdctl/` directory -- no database required. The StateManager module within `@herdctl/core` provides the full API for reading, writing, and querying this state, while the [FleetManager](/architecture/overview/) coordinates all state transitions during fleet operation.

## Directory Structure

The `.herdctl/` directory is created automatically in the project root when the fleet initializes. Its layout is:

```
.herdctl/
├── state.yaml              # Fleet state (agent status, schedules)
├── jobs/
│   ├── job-2024-01-19-abc123.yaml   # Job metadata
│   └── job-2024-01-19-abc123.jsonl  # Streaming output log
├── sessions/
│   └── <agent-name>.json   # Session info per agent
└── logs/
    └── <agent-name>.log    # Agent-level logs
```

### Visual Layout

<img src="/diagrams/state-directory.svg" alt="State directory structure diagram showing .herdctl directory with state.yaml, jobs, sessions, and logs subdirectories" width="100%" />

**Color key:** <span style="color:#1e3a5f">Navy</span> = root directory, <span style="color:#326CE5">Blue</span> = subdirectories, <span style="color:#fbbf24">Amber</span> = fleet state file, <span style="color:#6ee7b7">Mint</span> = job metadata (.yaml), <span style="color:#c4b5fd">Lavender</span> = streaming output (.jsonl), <span style="color:#38bdf8">Sky/Cyan</span> = session files (.json), <span style="color:#94a3b8">Slate/Gray</span> = agent logs (.log).

### Naming Conventions

- **Job files** use the pattern `job-YYYY-MM-DD-<random6>` with both a `.yaml` (metadata) and `.jsonl` (streaming output) per job.
- **Session files** use the agent's qualified name: `<agent-name>.json` for simple fleets, or `<fleet>.<agent>.json` for composed fleets.
- **Log files** use `<agent-name>.log`.

### Subdirectory Purposes

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `state.yaml` | Fleet-wide state including agent status and scheduling |
| `jobs/` | Individual job metadata (YAML) and streaming output (JSONL) |
| `sessions/` | Claude session information for resume/fork capability |
| `logs/` | Agent-level logs for debugging |

### Initialization

The `initStateDirectory()` function creates the full directory structure if it does not exist. It accepts an optional custom path (defaulting to `.herdctl/` in the current working directory) and performs the following steps:

1. Creates the root `.herdctl/` directory and all subdirectories (`jobs/`, `sessions/`, `logs/`) using `mkdir` with `recursive: true`.
2. Creates `state.yaml` with an empty fleet state if the file does not exist.
3. If `state.yaml` already exists, validates it against `FleetStateSchema` and throws a `StateFileError` if the file is corrupted or has an invalid schema.
4. Runs a final validation pass to confirm all directories and files are in place.

The function returns a `StateDirectory` object containing resolved paths to every component:

```typescript
interface StateDirectory {
  root: string;       // .herdctl/
  stateFile: string;  // .herdctl/state.yaml
  jobs: string;       // .herdctl/jobs/
  sessions: string;   // .herdctl/sessions/
  logs: string;       // .herdctl/logs/
}
```

Initialization errors produce descriptive messages. For example, a permission error yields a message like `"Permission denied: Cannot access '/path/.herdctl'. Check file permissions."` rather than a raw `EACCES` code.

## state.yaml Format

The `state.yaml` file tracks fleet-wide state. It is validated against `FleetStateSchema`, a Zod schema defined in `packages/core/src/state/schemas/fleet-state.ts`.

```yaml
# .herdctl/state.yaml
fleet:
  started_at: "2025-01-19T10:00:00Z"   # ISO timestamp when fleet started

agents:
  bragdoc-coder:
    status: idle              # idle | running | error
    current_job: null         # Job ID if currently running
    last_job: job-2024-01-19-abc123
    next_schedule: issue-check
    next_trigger_at: "2025-01-19T10:10:00Z"
    container_id: null        # Docker container ID (if using Docker)
    error_message: null       # Error message if status is 'error'

  bragdoc-marketer:
    status: running
    current_job: job-2024-01-19-def456
    last_job: job-2024-01-19-xyz789
    next_schedule: null
    next_trigger_at: null
    container_id: "def456"
```

### Zod Schema

The schema enforces types at runtime and applies defaults for missing fields:

```typescript
const FleetStateSchema = z.object({
  fleet: z.object({
    started_at: z.string().optional(),
  }).optional().default({}),
  agents: z.record(z.string(), AgentStateSchema).optional().default({}),
});
```

When `state.yaml` is missing or empty, the schema defaults produce a valid empty state (`{ fleet: {}, agents: {} }`).

### Agent State Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | `idle` \| `running` \| `error` | Current agent status |
| `current_job` | `string?` | ID of currently running job |
| `last_job` | `string?` | ID of the last completed job |
| `next_schedule` | `string?` | Name of the next scheduled trigger |
| `next_trigger_at` | `string?` | ISO timestamp of next scheduled run |
| `container_id` | `string?` | Docker container ID (if containerized) |
| `error_message` | `string?` | Error message when status is `error` |
| `schedules` | `Record<string, ScheduleState>?` | Per-schedule state map |

### Agent State Lifecycle

An agent transitions between three states:

- **`idle`**: The agent has no running job. `current_job` is `null`. The scheduler may have populated `next_schedule` and `next_trigger_at` to indicate when the next job will start.
- **`running`**: The agent is executing a job. `current_job` contains the active job ID. The [Runner](/architecture/runner/) set this state when execution began.
- **`error`**: The agent encountered a failure. `error_message` describes the problem. The agent remains in this state until the next successful job execution or manual reset.

State transitions are performed through `updateAgentState()`, which reads the current file, applies partial updates to a single agent, and writes back atomically. This ensures other agents' state is preserved.

## Job File Formats

Each [job](/concepts/jobs/) creates two files in `.herdctl/jobs/`. For details on job lifecycle and management, see [Job System](/architecture/job-system/).

### Job Metadata (YAML)

```yaml
# .herdctl/jobs/job-2024-01-19-abc123.yaml
id: job-2024-01-19-abc123
agent: bragdoc-marketer
schedule: daily-analytics
trigger_type: schedule        # manual | schedule | webhook | chat | discord | slack | web | fork

status: completed             # pending | running | completed | failed | cancelled
exit_reason: success          # success | error | timeout | cancelled | max_turns

session_id: claude-session-xyz789
forked_from: null             # Parent job ID if this was forked

started_at: "2024-01-19T09:00:00Z"
finished_at: "2024-01-19T09:05:23Z"
duration_seconds: 323

prompt: |
  Analyze site traffic for the past 24 hours.
  Create a brief report and post to #marketing channel.

summary: "Generated daily analytics report. Traffic up 12% from yesterday."
output_file: job-2024-01-19-abc123.jsonl
```

### Job Metadata Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Format: `job-YYYY-MM-DD-<random6>` (regex-validated) |
| `agent` | `string` | Name of the executing agent |
| `schedule` | `string?` | Schedule name that triggered the job |
| `trigger_type` | enum | How the job was started |
| `status` | enum | Current job status |
| `exit_reason` | enum | Why the job ended (when finished) |
| `session_id` | `string?` | Claude session ID for resume/fork |
| `forked_from` | `string?` | Parent job ID (for forked jobs) |
| `started_at` | `string` | ISO timestamp when job started |
| `finished_at` | `string?` | ISO timestamp when job finished |
| `duration_seconds` | `number?` | Total execution time |
| `prompt` | `string?` | The prompt given to the agent |
| `summary` | `string?` | Brief summary of job results |
| `output_file` | `string?` | Path to the JSONL output file |

### Job ID Generation

Job IDs follow the format `job-YYYY-MM-DD-<random6>`, where the random suffix is 6 lowercase alphanumeric characters generated from `Math.random().toString(36)`. The `generateJobId()` function accepts an optional `Date` and random function for deterministic testing:

```typescript
function generateJobId(
  date: Date = new Date(),
  randomFn: () => string = () => Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 8),
): string {
  const year = date.getFullYear();
  const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0");
  const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, "0");
  const random = randomFn().slice(0, 6).padEnd(6, "0");
  return `job-${year}-${month}-${day}-${random}`;
}
```

The `JobMetadataSchema` validates this format with a regex: `/^job-\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}-[a-z0-9]{6}$/`.

### Job Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Job created but not yet started |
| `running` | Job is currently executing |
| `completed` | Job finished successfully |
| `failed` | Job ended with an error |
| `cancelled` | Job was cancelled by user |

### Exit Reason Values

| Exit Reason | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `success` | Job completed naturally |
| `error` | Job failed due to an error |
| `timeout` | Job exceeded configured time limit |
| `cancelled` | Job was cancelled by user intervention |
| `max_turns` | Job reached maximum conversation turns |

### Trigger Types

| Trigger Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `manual` | Started via CLI or API call |
| `schedule` | Triggered by the [scheduler](/architecture/scheduler/) |
| `webhook` | Triggered by an external webhook |
| `chat` | Triggered by a generic chat message |
| `discord` | Triggered by a Discord message |
| `slack` | Triggered by a Slack message |
| `web` | Triggered from the web dashboard |
| `fork` | Forked from a previous job's session |

### Streaming Output (JSONL)

Job output is stored as newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) for efficient streaming. The [Runner](/architecture/runner/) writes to this file in real time as the agent executes:

```jsonl
{"type":"system","subtype":"init","timestamp":"2024-01-19T09:00:00Z"}
{"type":"assistant","content":"I'll analyze the traffic data...","timestamp":"2024-01-19T09:00:01Z"}
{"type":"tool_use","tool_name":"Bash","input":"node scripts/get-analytics.js","timestamp":"2024-01-19T09:00:02Z"}
{"type":"tool_result","result":"...analytics output...","success":true,"timestamp":"2024-01-19T09:00:05Z"}
{"type":"assistant","content":"Traffic is up 12% from yesterday...","timestamp":"2024-01-19T09:00:10Z"}
```

JSONL properties:

- **Streamable**: Each line is self-contained, so the file can be read while still being written to.
- **Append-only**: New messages are appended, never inserted or overwritten.
- **Replayable**: The full conversation can be reconstructed by reading the file from top to bottom.
- **No buffering**: Messages are written immediately via `fs.appendFile` so external monitors see output in real time.

## JSONL Message Types

All messages include a `type` field and `timestamp`. The schema uses a Zod discriminated union on the `type` field, defined in `packages/core/src/state/schemas/job-output.ts`. The five message types are:

### system

System events like session initialization:

```json
{
  "type": "system",
  "subtype": "init",
  "content": "Session initialized",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-19T09:00:00Z"
}
```

Fields: `content` (optional string), `subtype` (optional string, e.g., `"init"`).

### assistant

Claude's text responses:

```json
{
  "type": "assistant",
  "content": "I'll analyze the traffic data...",
  "partial": false,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 1500,
    "output_tokens": 200
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-19T09:00:01Z"
}
```

Fields: `content` (optional string), `partial` (optional boolean indicating streaming chunk), `usage` (optional object with `input_tokens` and `output_tokens`).

### tool_use

Tool invocations by Claude:

```json
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_use_id": "toolu_abc123",
  "input": "gh issue list --label ready --json number,title",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-19T09:00:02Z"
}
```

Fields: `tool_name` (string), `tool_use_id` (optional string), `input` (optional, any type).

### tool_result

Results from tool execution:

```json
{
  "type": "tool_result",
  "tool_use_id": "toolu_abc123",
  "result": "[{\"number\":42,\"title\":\"Fix auth timeout\"}]",
  "success": true,
  "error": null,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-19T09:00:05Z"
}
```

Fields: `tool_use_id` (optional string), `result` (optional, any type), `success` (optional boolean), `error` (optional string).

### error

Error messages:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "message": "Tool execution failed",
  "code": "TOOL_ERROR",
  "stack": "...",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-19T09:00:05Z"
}
```

Fields: `message` (required string), `code` (optional string), `stack` (optional string).

### Input Types

When appending messages via the API, timestamps are added automatically. The `JobOutputInput` type accepts any of the five message types without the `timestamp` field. The `isValidJobOutputInput()` function provides a type guard that checks for the presence of a valid `type` field.

## Session Info Format

Session files track Claude session state for resume/fork capability. They are stored as JSON in `.herdctl/sessions/` and validated against `SessionInfoSchema`.

```json
{
  "agent_name": "bragdoc-coder",
  "session_id": "claude-session-xyz789",
  "created_at": "2024-01-19T08:00:00Z",
  "last_used_at": "2024-01-19T10:05:00Z",
  "job_count": 15,
  "mode": "autonomous",
  "working_directory": "/home/user/project",
  "runtime_type": "sdk",
  "docker_enabled": false
}
```

### Session Info Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `agent_name` | `string` | Agent this session belongs to (qualified name for composed fleets) |
| `session_id` | `string` | Claude session ID for resuming conversations |
| `created_at` | `string` (ISO) | When the session was created |
| `last_used_at` | `string` (ISO) | When the session was last used |
| `job_count` | `number` | Number of jobs executed in this session |
| `mode` | enum | Operational mode of the session |
| `working_directory` | `string?` | Working directory when the session was created |
| `runtime_type` | `"sdk"` \| `"cli"` | Runtime type used when the session was created |
| `docker_enabled` | `boolean` | Whether Docker was enabled when the session was created |

The `working_directory` and `runtime_type` fields are used for session invalidation. If the working directory changes or the runtime type switches between SDK and CLI, the existing session may no longer be valid and a fresh session is started.

### Session Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `autonomous` | Agent runs independently |
| `interactive` | Human-in-the-loop mode |
| `review` | Review/approval required for actions |

For more on sessions, see [Sessions](/concepts/sessions/).

## Schedule State

Each agent can have multiple schedules, each with its own state tracked within the agent's entry in `state.yaml`. The [Scheduler](/architecture/scheduler/) manages these state transitions during the polling loop.

```yaml
agents:
  my-agent:
    status: idle
    schedules:
      check-issues:
        status: idle           # idle | running | disabled
        last_run_at: "2025-01-19T10:05:00Z"
        next_run_at: "2025-01-19T10:10:00Z"
        last_error: null
      daily-report:
        status: running
        last_run_at: "2025-01-19T09:00:00Z"
        next_run_at: null
        last_error: null
```

### Schedule State Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | `idle` \| `running` \| `disabled` | Current schedule status |
| `last_run_at` | `string?` (ISO) | When the schedule last completed |
| `next_run_at` | `string?` (ISO) | Calculated next trigger time |
| `last_error` | `string?` | Error message from last failure |

The `createDefaultScheduleState()` factory function initializes a new schedule with `idle` status and all nullable fields set to `null`.

For more details on schedule state, see [Scheduler Architecture](/architecture/scheduler/).

## Atomic Write Pattern

All state file writes (YAML and JSON) use atomic writes to prevent corruption. This is implemented in `packages/core/src/state/utils/atomic.ts`.

### How It Works

1. **Write to temp file**: Content is written to `.<filename>.tmp.<random>` in the same directory as the target. The random suffix is 16 hex characters from `crypto.randomBytes(8)`. Writing to the same directory ensures the temp file is on the same filesystem, which is required for atomic rename.

2. **Atomic rename**: The temp file is renamed to the target path using `fs.rename`. On POSIX systems (Linux, macOS), rename is an atomic operation -- the file either appears with the complete content or does not appear at all.

3. **Cleanup on failure**: If either the write or rename fails, the temp file is removed (best-effort, ignoring `ENOENT`). The original file remains untouched.

```typescript
// Simplified implementation
async function atomicWriteFile(filePath: string, content: string): Promise<void> {
  const tempPath = join(dirname(filePath), `.${basename(filePath)}.tmp.${randomHex}`);
  try {
    await writeFile(tempPath, content, "utf-8");
    await renameWithRetry(tempPath, filePath);
  } catch (error) {
    await cleanupTempFile(tempPath);
    throw new AtomicWriteError(/* ... */);
  }
}
```

This pattern ensures:

- **No partial writes**: Files are never in an incomplete state visible to readers.
- **Crash safety**: If the process crashes mid-write, the original file remains intact.
- **Concurrent safety**: Multiple readers will never see incomplete data.

### Convenience Wrappers

Two higher-level functions build on `atomicWriteFile`:

- `atomicWriteYaml(filePath, data)` -- Serializes data to YAML (via the `yaml` library with 2-space indent) and writes atomically.
- `atomicWriteJson(filePath, data)` -- Serializes data to JSON (with 2-space indent) and writes atomically.

### JSONL Append Semantics

JSONL files use a different strategy from YAML/JSON files. Instead of atomic write-and-replace, they use `fs.appendFile`, which appends a single line at a time:

```typescript
async function appendJsonl(filePath: string, data: unknown): Promise<void> {
  const line = JSON.stringify(data) + "\n";
  await appendFile(filePath, line, "utf-8");
}
```

Key properties of this approach:

- **Message-level atomicity**: On most systems, `appendFile` writes are atomic for reasonably sized lines (under the filesystem's write buffer size, typically 4KB+). Each JSONL line is a complete JSON object.
- **No buffering**: Each message is written immediately, so external tools (CLI, web dashboard) can monitor output in real time.
- **Append-only**: The file is never rewritten or truncated during normal operation.
- **Failure isolation**: If an append fails, all previously written lines remain intact.

### Windows Compatibility

On Windows, `fs.rename` can fail with `EACCES` or `EPERM` if another process has the target file open (common with antivirus scanners and indexing services). The `renameWithRetry` function handles this with exponential backoff:

```typescript
async function renameWithRetry(oldPath, newPath, options = {}): Promise<void> {
  const { maxRetries = 3, baseDelayMs = 50 } = options;
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      await rename(oldPath, newPath);
      return;
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.code !== "EACCES" && error.code !== "EPERM") throw error;
      if (attempt < maxRetries) {
        await sleep(baseDelayMs * 2 ** attempt); // 50ms, 100ms, 200ms
      }
    }
  }
  throw lastError;
}
```

Only `EACCES` and `EPERM` errors trigger retries. All other errors (e.g., `ENOENT`, `ENOSPC`) propagate immediately.

## Safe Read Operations

Read operations are designed for concurrent access without locks. The utilities in `packages/core/src/state/utils/reads.ts` handle the edge cases that arise when reading files that may be in the middle of an atomic write.

### safeReadYaml

Reads and parses a YAML file with retry logic:

- **Transient error detection**: YAML parse errors and JSON syntax errors (`"unexpected end"`, `"unexpected token"`) are treated as potentially transient, since they can occur when reading during an atomic write before the rename completes.
- **Exponential backoff**: Up to 3 retries with delays of 10ms, 20ms, 40ms (configurable).
- **Non-retryable errors**: `ENOENT` (file not found), `EACCES`, and `EPERM` are returned immediately as failures.
- **Empty files**: An empty YAML file returns `null` per the YAML specification.
- **Result type**: Returns `{ success: true, data }` or `{ success: false, error }` for explicit error handling.

### safeReadJsonl

Reads and parses a JSONL file, handling incomplete content:

- **Incomplete last line**: The last line (or second-to-last if the file ends with a newline) is silently skipped if it fails to parse. This handles the case where a read occurs while an `appendFile` is in progress.
- **Middle-line errors**: Invalid lines in the middle of the file either throw (default) or skip (`skipInvalidLines: true` option).
- **Empty files**: Returns an empty array.
- **Tracking**: Returns a `skippedLines` count alongside the parsed data.

### safeReadJson

Reads and parses a JSON file with the same retry logic as `safeReadYaml`, handling transient errors from concurrent atomic writes.

## Error Handling

The state module uses a typed error hierarchy for precise error discrimination:

| Error Class | When Thrown |
|-------------|------------|
| `StateError` | Base class for all state errors |
| `StateDirectoryCreateError` | Directory creation fails (includes system `code` like `EACCES`) |
| `StateDirectoryValidationError` | Directory structure is invalid (includes list of `missingPaths`) |
| `StateFileError` | State file read/write fails (includes `path` and `operation`) |
| `AtomicWriteError` | Atomic write fails (includes `path` and `tempPath`) |
| `SafeReadError` | Safe read fails after retries (includes `path` and system `code`) |

All errors include the original cause via the standard `Error.cause` property, enabling full stack trace inspection. The `getPermissionErrorMessage()` utility translates system error codes into human-readable messages (e.g., `EACCES` becomes `"Permission denied: Cannot access '/path'. Check file permissions."`).

## Debugging State Issues

### Inspect Current State

```bash
# View fleet state
cat .herdctl/state.yaml

# View specific job
cat .herdctl/jobs/job-2024-01-19-abc123.yaml

# View job output (streaming log)
cat .herdctl/jobs/job-2024-01-19-abc123.jsonl

# View session info
cat .herdctl/sessions/bragdoc-coder.json

# Count lines in a job output
wc -l .herdctl/jobs/job-2024-01-19-abc123.jsonl

# Search for errors in job output
grep '"type":"error"' .herdctl/jobs/job-2024-01-19-abc123.jsonl
```

### Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Agent stuck in `running` | Process crash during job execution | Edit `state.yaml` and set the agent's `status` to `idle` and `current_job` to `null` |
| Missing job output | Write failure during execution | Check disk space (`df -h`) and directory permissions (`ls -la .herdctl/jobs/`) |
| Session won't resume | Invalid or stale session ID | Delete the agent's session file from `.herdctl/sessions/` |
| Session invalidated unexpectedly | Working directory or runtime type changed | Check `working_directory` and `runtime_type` in the session file against current config |
| Stale temp files (`.*.tmp.*`) | Previous process crashed mid-write | Safe to delete manually; atomic writes ensure the original file was not corrupted |
| `StateDirectoryValidationError` | Subdirectory accidentally deleted | Re-run the fleet to trigger `initStateDirectory()`, or manually `mkdir` the missing directory |
| `StateFileError` on startup | Corrupted `state.yaml` (e.g., from manual edit) | Fix the YAML syntax, or delete `state.yaml` and restart (a fresh empty state will be created) |

### Verifying State Consistency

To check that the on-disk state matches expectations:

```bash
# List all jobs with their status
for f in .herdctl/jobs/*.yaml; do
  echo "$(basename "$f"): $(grep 'status:' "$f" | head -1)"
done

# Find agents still marked as running
grep -A1 'status: running' .herdctl/state.yaml

# Check for orphaned temp files (should not exist during normal operation)
ls -la .herdctl/.*.tmp.* 2>/dev/null
ls -la .herdctl/jobs/.*.tmp.* 2>/dev/null
```
