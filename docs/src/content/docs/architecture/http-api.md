title: HTTP API
description: REST endpoints, WebSocket real-time streaming, and server architecture for the herdctl web API layer
---

The HTTP API is a thin REST layer over [FleetManager](/architecture/overview/). Like the [CLI](/architecture/cli/), it contains no business logic of its own -- every endpoint delegates to a FleetManager method and returns the result. The API powers the [web dashboard](/architecture/web-dashboard/) and can be consumed by external scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or custom integrations.

## Design Principles

The API follows the same **thin client** principle as every other interaction layer in herdctl:

1. **FleetManager is the single source of truth.** Every REST endpoint calls a FleetManager method. No endpoint reads state files directly or manages agent lifecycle on its own.
2. **REST for queries and commands, WebSocket for real-time events.** Clients fetch initial state via REST and receive incremental updates via a single WebSocket connection.
3. **No authentication (MVP).** The API is designed for local use on `localhost`. Authentication is planned but not yet implemented.
4. **Consistent error responses.** All errors return a JSON object with `error` and `statusCode` fields.

## Server Architecture

### Fastify

The HTTP API uses [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) as its server framework. Fastify was chosen over Express for its TypeScript-first design, built-in WebSocket support via `@fastify/websocket`, plugin architecture, and request/response schema validation.

The server is created by the `createWebServer()` factory function in `packages/web/src/server/index.ts`. It registers:

- **CORS** via `@fastify/cors` (allows localhost origins for development)
- **WebSocket** via `@fastify/websocket`
- **Static file serving** via `@fastify/static` (serves the built React SPA)
- **REST route modules** for fleet, agents, jobs, schedules, and chat
- **SPA fallback** handler that serves `index.html` for client-side routing

### WebManager Lifecycle

`WebManager` is the IChatManager implementation for the web platform. FleetManager dynamically imports `@herdctl/web` at startup when the fleet configuration includes a `web` block with `enabled: true`. WebManager follows the same lifecycle as the Discord and Slack managers:

```
FleetManager.initialize()
  -> WebManager.initialize()     # Creates Fastify server, registers routes
  -> FleetManager.start()
       -> WebManager.start()     # Starts listening on host:port, starts FleetBridge
  -> FleetManager.stop()
       -> WebManager.stop()      # Stops FleetBridge, closes WebSocket connections, shuts down Fastify
```

The server binds to the host and port specified in `herdctl.yaml`:

```yaml
web:
  enabled: true
  port: 3232
  host: localhost
```

### Route Registration

Routes are organized into focused modules, each receiving the Fastify instance and FleetManager reference:

| Module | File | Endpoints |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Fleet | `routes/fleet.ts` | Fleet status |
| Agents | `routes/agents.ts` | Agent listing and detail |
| Jobs | `routes/jobs.ts` | Job listing, detail, cancel, fork |
| Schedules | `routes/schedules.ts` | Schedule listing, trigger, enable/disable |
| Chat | `routes/chat.ts` | Chat session management and messaging |
| System | `index.ts` (inline) | Health check, version |

## REST Endpoint Reference

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`. Responses are JSON.

### Fleet

| Method | Path | Description | FleetManager Method |
|--------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `GET` | `/api/fleet/status` | Fleet status including state, uptime, agent count, job counts, scheduler state | `getFleetStatus()` |

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "startedAt": "2025-01-20T10:00:00Z",
  "agentCount": 3,
  "runningJobCount": 1,
  "schedulerState": "running"
}
```

### Agents

| Method | Path | Description | FleetManager Method |
|--------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `GET` | `/api/agents` | List all agents with status, schedules, and connector info | `getAgentInfo()` |
| `GET` | `/api/agents/:name` | Get detailed info for a single agent by qualified name or local name | `getAgentInfoByName(name)` |

The `:name` parameter accepts either a qualified name (e.g., `herdctl.security-auditor`) or a local name (e.g., `security-auditor`). If the agent is not found, the endpoint returns `404`.

**Example response for `GET /api/agents/:name`:**

```json
{
  "name": "security-auditor",
  "qualifiedName": "herdctl.security-auditor",
  "description": "Runs security audits on the codebase",
  "status": "idle",
  "currentJobId": null,
  "lastJobId": "job-2025-01-20-abc123",
  "schedules": [
    {
      "name": "daily-audit",
      "type": "cron",
      "expression": "0 6 * * *",
      "status": "idle",
      "lastRunAt": "2025-01-20T06:00:00Z",
      "nextRunAt": "2025-01-21T06:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "chatConnectors": {
    "discord": { "status": "connected" },
    "slack": { "status": "disconnected" }
  }
}
```

### Jobs

| Method | Path | Description | FleetManager Method |
|--------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `GET` | `/api/jobs` | List jobs with pagination and filtering | `listJobs()` (core utility) |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs/:id` | Get full metadata for a single job | `getJob()` (core utility) |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/:id/cancel` | Cancel a running job | `cancelJob(id)` |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/:id/fork` | Fork a job, optionally with a new prompt | `forkJob(id, modifications)` |

**Query parameters for `GET /api/jobs`:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `limit` | number | 50 | Max results (clamped to 1-100) |
| `offset` | number | 0 | Pagination offset |
| `agentName` | string | -- | Filter by agent qualified name |
| `status` | string | -- | Filter by status: `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled` |

**Example response for `GET /api/jobs`:**

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "jobId": "job-2025-01-20-abc123",
      "agentName": "herdctl.security-auditor",
      "prompt": "Run daily security audit...",
      "status": "completed",
      "createdAt": "2025-01-20T06:00:00Z",
      "startedAt": "2025-01-20T06:00:00Z",
      "completedAt": "2025-01-20T06:05:30Z",
      "exitCode": 0,
      "sessionId": "claude-session-xyz",
      "triggerType": "scheduled",
      "workspace": "/home/user/projects/my-app"
    }
  ],
  "total": 142,
  "limit": 50,
  "offset": 0,
  "errors": []
}
```

**Fork request body:**

```json
{
  "prompt": "Try a different approach to the security issue"
}
```

The `prompt` field is optional. If omitted, the fork uses the original job's configuration.

### Schedules

| Method | Path | Description | FleetManager Method |
|--------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `GET` | `/api/schedules` | List all schedules across all agents | `getSchedules()` |
| `POST` | `/api/agents/:name/trigger` | Trigger a job for an agent, optionally targeting a specific schedule | `trigger(name, scheduleName, options)` |
| `POST` | `/api/schedules/:agentName/:scheduleName/enable` | Enable a disabled schedule | `enableSchedule(agentName, scheduleName)` |
| `POST` | `/api/schedules/:agentName/:scheduleName/disable` | Disable an active schedule | `disableSchedule(agentName, scheduleName)` |

**Trigger request body:**

```json
{
  "scheduleName": "issue-check",
  "prompt": "Custom prompt override"
}
```

Both fields are optional. If `scheduleName` is omitted, the agent's default trigger behavior applies. If `prompt` is provided, it overrides the schedule's configured prompt.

### Chat

The chat API manages web chat sessions. Actual message streaming happens via the [WebSocket protocol](#websocket-protocol), but REST endpoints handle session lifecycle and provide a non-streaming message endpoint.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/chat/recent` | List recent sessions across all agents (sorted by last activity) |
| `GET` | `/api/chat/config` | Get chat configuration defaults (message grouping, tool results) |
| `POST` | `/api/chat/:agentName/sessions` | Create a new chat session for an agent |
| `GET` | `/api/chat/:agentName/sessions` | List all sessions for an agent |
| `GET` | `/api/chat/:agentName/sessions/:sessionId` | Get session details with full message history |
| `DELETE` | `/api/chat/:agentName/sessions/:sessionId` | Delete a chat session |
| `PATCH` | `/api/chat/:agentName/sessions/:sessionId` | Rename a session (set custom name) |
| `POST` | `/api/chat/:agentName/sessions/:sessionId/messages` | Send a message (non-streaming, waits for full response) |

**Create session response (`201 Created`):**

```json
{
  "sessionId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-20T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Session detail response:**

```json
{
  "sessionId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "agentName": "herdctl.my-agent",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-20T12:00:00.000Z",
  "lastMessageAt": "2025-01-20T12:05:30.000Z",
  "messageCount": 4,
  "preview": "What issues are open on the repo?",
  "customName": "Issue triage session",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What issues are open on the repo?",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-20T12:00:01.000Z"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'll check the open issues for you...",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-20T12:00:03.000Z"
    },
    {
      "role": "tool",
      "content": "Found 3 open issues...",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-20T12:00:05.000Z",
      "toolCall": {
        "toolName": "Bash",
        "inputSummary": "gh issue list --state open",
        "output": "Found 3 open issues...",
        "isError": false,
        "durationMs": 1200
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Send message request body:**

```json
{
  "message": "What issues are open on the repo?"
}
```

The REST message endpoint collects all streaming chunks and returns the complete response synchronously. For real-time streaming, use the WebSocket `chat:send` message type instead.

**Rename request body:**

```json
{
  "name": "Issue triage session"
}
```

### System

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Health check (returns `{ status: "ok", timestamp }`) |
| `GET` | `/api/version` | Package versions for web, CLI, and core |

**Health check response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-20T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Version response:**

```json
{
  "web": "0.5.0",
  "cli": "0.5.0",
  "core": "0.5.0"
}
```

## WebSocket Protocol

The API provides a single WebSocket endpoint at `/ws`. Clients open one connection and receive all event types multiplexed over that connection. This avoids the complexity of managing multiple connections and simplifies reconnection logic.

### Connection Lifecycle

1. Client connects to `ws://localhost:3232/ws`
2. Server immediately sends a `fleet:status` message with a full fleet status snapshot
3. Client sends `subscribe` messages for agents whose output it wants to stream
4. Server broadcasts events as they occur
5. Client sends `ping` messages periodically for keepalive; server responds with `pong`
6. On disconnect, the server cleans up the client's subscription state

### Client Messages

Messages sent from the browser to the server:

| Type | Payload | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `subscribe` | `{ agentName }` | Subscribe to an agent's `job:output` events |
| `unsubscribe` | `{ agentName }` | Stop receiving an agent's `job:output` events |
| `ping` | (none) | Keepalive ping |
| `chat:send` | `{ agentName, sessionId, message }` | Send a chat message to an agent |

**Example subscribe message:**

```json
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "payload": {
    "agentName": "herdctl.security-auditor"
  }
}
```

**Example chat send message:**

```json
{
  "type": "chat:send",
  "payload": {
    "agentName": "herdctl.my-agent",
    "sessionId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
    "message": "Check the open issues"
  }
}
```

### Server Messages

Messages sent from the server to connected browsers:

#### Fleet and Agent Events

| Type | Payload | Broadcast Scope | Description |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| `fleet:status` | `FleetStatus` | Single client | Full fleet snapshot, sent on connection |
| `agent:updated` | `AgentStartedPayload` or `AgentStoppedPayload` | All clients | Agent lifecycle change |

#### Job Events

| Type | Payload | Broadcast Scope | Description |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| `job:created` | `JobCreatedPayload` | All clients | New job started |
| `job:output` | `JobOutputPayload` | Subscribed clients only | Streaming job output (high volume) |
| `job:completed` | `JobCompletedPayload` | All clients | Job finished successfully |
| `job:failed` | `JobFailedPayload` | All clients | Job failed with error |
| `job:cancelled` | `JobCancelledPayload` | All clients | Job was cancelled |

#### Schedule Events

| Type | Payload | Broadcast Scope | Description |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| `schedule:triggered` | `ScheduleTriggeredPayload` | All clients | A schedule fired |

#### Chat Events

| Type | Payload | Broadcast Scope | Description |
|------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| `chat:response` | `{ agentName, sessionId, jobId, chunk }` | Requesting client | Streaming text chunk from agent |
| `chat:tool_call` | `{ agentName, sessionId, jobId, toolName, inputSummary?, output, isError, durationMs? }` | Requesting client | Tool call result during chat |
| `chat:message_boundary` | `{ agentName, sessionId, jobId }` | Requesting client | Boundary between distinct assistant text turns |
| `chat:complete` | `{ agentName, sessionId, jobId }` | Requesting client | Chat response finished |
| `chat:error` | `{ agentName, sessionId, error }` | Requesting client | Chat error occurred |

#### Keepalive

| Type | Payload | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `pong` | (none) | Response to client `ping` |

### Subscription-Based Filtering

Not all events are sent to all clients. The FleetBridge distinguishes between **low-volume events** (broadcast to all clients) and **high-volume events** (sent only to subscribed clients):

- **Broadcast to all**: `fleet:status`, `agent:updated`, `job:created`, `job:completed`, `job:failed`, `job:cancelled`, `schedule:triggered`
- **Subscribers only**: `job:output` (sent only to clients that have sent a `subscribe` message for the relevant agent)
- **Requesting client only**: All `chat:*` messages (sent only to the client that initiated the `chat:send`)

This filtering prevents flooding inactive dashboard tabs with high-volume output data from agents the user is not viewing.

## FleetBridge: Event Relay

The `FleetBridge` class connects FleetManager's event system to WebSocket clients. It subscribes to FleetManager events at startup and translates them into WebSocket server messages:

```
FleetManager Events          FleetBridge           WebSocket Clients

agent:started     -------->  broadcast()  -------->  All clients
agent:stopped     -------->  broadcast()  -------->  All clients
job:created       -------->  broadcast()  -------->  All clients
job:output        -------->  broadcastToSubscribers() --> Subscribed clients
job:completed     -------->  broadcast()  -------->  All clients
job:failed        -------->  broadcast()  -------->  All clients
job:cancelled     -------->  broadcast()  -------->  All clients
schedule:triggered ------->  broadcast()  -------->  All clients
```

The FleetBridge properly cleans up event listeners when stopped, preventing memory leaks. It stores bound handler references so that `fleetManager.off()` calls remove the correct listeners.

## Error Responses

All error responses use a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "error": "Descriptive error message",
  "statusCode": 404
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Usage |
|-------------|-------|
| `200` | Successful GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE |
| `201` | Resource created (e.g., new chat session) |
| `400` | Invalid request (missing required fields, malformed input) |
| `404` | Resource not found (agent, job, session) |
| `500` | Internal server error |
| `503` | Client build not available (SPA not built) |

Error detection is string-based: if a FleetManager error message contains "not found" (case-insensitive), the API returns `404`. All other errors return `500`. This approach avoids coupling the API layer to specific error class hierarchies while still providing meaningful status codes.

## CORS Configuration

The server configures CORS via `@fastify/cors` to allow requests from known development origins:

- `http://localhost:3232` and `http://127.0.0.1:3232` (production server)
- `http://localhost:5173` and `http://127.0.0.1:5173` (Vite dev server)
- The configured `host:port` combination from the web config

Allowed methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `OPTIONS`.

:::note
CORS is configured for development convenience. In production, the React SPA is served from the same origin as the API, so CORS is not a factor. When accessed through a reverse proxy, the proxy handles CORS headers.
:::

## Authentication

:::note
Authentication is not yet implemented. The API currently has no auth layer. All endpoints are accessible to any client that can reach the server.
:::

The API is designed for local use. Security is handled at the network level:

- **Default binding**: The server binds to `localhost` by default, preventing LAN access.
- **Warning on exposure**: When `host` is set to `0.0.0.0`, the web dashboard displays a warning about the security implications.
- **Reverse proxy pattern**: For remote access, the recommended approach is placing a reverse proxy (Caddy, Nginx + OAuth2 Proxy, Authelia) in front of the herdctl server. The proxy handles authentication and sets headers like `X-Forwarded-User`.

The Fastify plugin architecture supports adding authentication middleware without restructuring routes. When authentication is added, it will be injected as a Fastify preHandler hook that checks all `/api/*` routes.

**Planned authentication options:**

1. **Bearer token** -- A simple `auth_token` config field. When set, the server requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on all HTTP requests and the initial WebSocket handshake.
2. **API keys** -- Token-based auth for scripts and CI integrations.
3. **OIDC/OAuth** -- Enterprise SSO integration for multi-user deployments.

## Chat Integration

The web chat system uses `WebChatManager` to manage chat sessions. Unlike the monitoring endpoints that purely query FleetManager state, the chat system maintains its own persistent state for conversation history.

### Session Model

Chat sessions are **server-managed, per-agent, and shared**:

- Sessions are stored in `.herdctl/web/chat-history/<agentName>/<sessionId>.json`
- Each agent can have multiple concurrent chat sessions
- Sessions are visible to all connected browsers (no per-user scoping)
- Session IDs are server-generated UUIDs
- Sessions expire after `session_expiry_hours` (default: 24 hours)

There is no concept of user identity in the web API. Any browser can see, continue, or delete any session. This design reflects the typical use case: a single operator (or small team) using the dashboard on `localhost`.

### Message Flow

When a user sends a chat message, the flow differs depending on whether they use the REST or WebSocket interface:

**REST path** (`POST /api/chat/:agentName/sessions/:sessionId/messages`):

1. Validate session exists
2. Call `WebChatManager.sendMessage()` with a chunk collector callback
3. Wait for the agent to complete its response
4. Return the full accumulated response

**WebSocket path** (`chat:send` message):

1. Validate session exists via WebChatManager
2. Call `WebChatManager.sendMessage()` with streaming callbacks
3. Stream `chat:response` chunks, `chat:tool_call` results, and `chat:message_boundary` signals back to the requesting client in real time
4. Send `chat:complete` when finished (or `chat:error` on failure)

Both paths use the same underlying `WebChatManager.sendMessage()` method, which triggers a FleetManager job with `triggerType: "web"` and streams the agent's response via SDK message callbacks. The `@herdctl/chat` package's `ChatSessionManager` handles SDK session tracking for conversation continuity across multiple messages.

## SPA Serving

The Fastify server doubles as a static file server for the React SPA. In production, Vite builds the client to `dist/client/`, and `@fastify/static` serves these files from the root path `/`.

A custom `setNotFoundHandler` implements SPA fallback routing:

- Requests to `/api/*`, `/ws`, or `/assets/*` that don't match a route return `404`
- All other requests serve `index.html`, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing
- If the client build doesn't exist (e.g., development mode), the server returns `503` with a message to run `pnpm build:client`

## Development vs Production

| Aspect | Development | Production |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Frontend** | Vite dev server on port 5173 with HMR | Pre-built static files served by Fastify |
| **API server** | Fastify on configured port | Fastify on configured port |
| **Proxy** | Vite proxies `/api/*` and `/ws/*` to Fastify | Everything on a single port |
| **CORS** | Required (cross-origin between Vite and Fastify) | Not needed (same origin) |
| **npm package** | Server code only | Server code + pre-built SPA assets |
