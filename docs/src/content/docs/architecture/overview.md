This page is the entry point for the herdctl architecture section. It describes the overall shape of the system: what the major subsystems are, how they relate to each other, and how data flows at runtime. Start here before diving into any individual subsystem.

## System Architecture Diagram

The following diagram shows how `@herdctl/core` sits at the center of the system, with FleetManager orchestrating all internal modules and exposing a unified API to every interaction layer.

## Package Dependency Graph

herdctl is organized as a monorepo with six npm packages. Dependencies flow strictly in one direction: interaction-layer packages depend on core, never the reverse.

![Package dependency graph showing relationships between @herdctl/core, @herdctl/chat, @herdctl/discord, @herdctl/slack, @herdctl/web, and herdctl CLI](/diagrams/package-dependencies.svg)

| Package | npm Name | Role |
|---------|----------|------|
| **core** | `@herdctl/core` | All business logic: configuration, state, runner, scheduler, work sources, FleetManager orchestration. Every other package depends on this. |
| **chat** | `@herdctl/chat` | Shared chat infrastructure: session management, streaming response buffering, message extraction, error handling. Used by Discord and Slack connectors. |
| **discord** | `@herdctl/discord` | Discord connector: discord.js client, slash commands, mention handling, per-agent bot model. Depends on core and chat. |
| **slack** | `@herdctl/slack` | Slack connector: Bolt App, Socket Mode, prefix commands, channel-to-agent routing, single-app model. Depends on core and chat. |
| **web** | `@herdctl/web` | Web dashboard and HTTP API: Vite + React frontend, Fastify backend, real-time event streaming. Depends on core. |
| **cli** | `herdctl` | Command-line interface: thin wrapper over FleetManager. Depends on core. |

Core never imports from any interaction-layer package. Instead, FleetManager discovers optional packages (`@herdctl/discord`, `@herdctl/slack`, `@herdctl/web`) at runtime via dynamic imports when the fleet configuration references them. This avoids hard dependencies on optional packages that a user may not have installed.

## Core Design Principles

### Library-First Design

All business logic lives in `@herdctl/core`. The CLI, web dashboard, HTTP API, and chat connectors are thin wrappers that delegate to FleetManager. A developer can use `@herdctl/core` directly as a library without any interaction layer:

```typescript
import { FleetManager } from "@herdctl/core";

const fleet = new FleetManager({
  configPath: "./agents",
  stateDir: "./.herdctl",
});

await fleet.initialize();
await fleet.start();

// Subscribe to events
fleet.on("job:completed", (payload) => {
  console.log(`Job ${payload.job.id} finished in ${payload.durationSeconds}s`);
});

// Query state
const status = fleet.getFleetStatus();

// Trigger manually
await fleet.trigger("my-agent");

// Shut down
await fleet.stop({ waitForJobs: true, timeout: 30000 });
```

### Thin Clients

Each interaction layer adds only what is specific to its medium:

- **CLI** adds argument parsing, output formatting, and exit code handling.
- **Web** adds HTTP routing, SSE/WebSocket transport, and React rendering.
- **Discord** adds discord.js event handling, slash commands, and rich embeds.
- **Slack** adds Bolt event handling, Socket Mode, and mrkdwn conversion.

None of these packages contain business logic. They translate between their medium and FleetManager's API.

### Single Process Model

A fleet runs in a single Node.js process. FleetManager manages the scheduler loop, configuration, and state within that process. Agents are executed as child processes (via the Claude SDK or CLI) or as Docker containers, but FleetManager itself is not distributed.

### Module Composition

FleetManager uses composition rather than inheritance. Internal functionality is split into focused module classes that each receive a shared `FleetManagerContext` interface. This keeps individual files small and testable while presenting a single public API surface. See [Module Composition Pattern](#module-composition-pattern) below for details.

## FleetManager: The Central Orchestrator

FleetManager is the single orchestration point for the entire system. All interaction layers go through FleetManager rather than calling lower-level modules directly.

### What FleetManager Owns

| Responsibility | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Lifecycle management** | `initialize()`, `start()`, `stop()`, `reload()` -- full fleet lifecycle |
| **Configuration loading** | Delegates to ConfigLoader to discover, parse, validate, and resolve `herdctl.yaml` |
| **State directory setup** | Delegates to StateManager to create and manage the `.herdctl/` directory |
| **Scheduler creation** | Creates and controls the Scheduler instance with trigger callbacks routed back into FleetManager |
| **Job execution** | Creates jobs via JobManager, hands execution to the Runner, streams output, reports completion |
| **Event emission** | Typed events for all lifecycle transitions, consumed by the web dashboard, CLI, and library consumers |
| **Chat manager loading** | Dynamically imports and initializes Discord, Slack, and Web managers when configured |
| **Schedule control** | Enable/disable schedules at runtime without editing config files |
| **Hot config reload** | Reload configuration without restarting; running jobs continue with their original config |

### What FleetManager Delegates

| Component | Source | Responsibility |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **ConfigLoader** | `config/` | Discovers `herdctl.yaml`, parses YAML, validates with Zod schemas, resolves fleet composition (sub-fleets), merges defaults, interpolates environment variables. See [Configuration System](/architecture/configuration/). |
| **Scheduler** | `scheduler/` | Polling loop that checks agent schedules (interval and cron). Evaluates trigger conditions, respects concurrency limits, fires callbacks into FleetManager. See [Schedule System](/architecture/scheduler/). |
| **StateManager** | `state/` | Manages the `.herdctl/` directory: fleet state (`state.yaml`), job metadata (YAML), streaming output (JSONL), and session info (JSON). All writes are atomic. See [State Persistence](/architecture/state-management/). |
| **Runner** | `runner/` | Executes agents. The SDK adapter transforms agent config into Claude SDK options. Supports SDK runtime, CLI runtime, and Docker runtime. Streams messages in real time. See [Agent Execution Engine](/architecture/runner/). |
| **JobManager** | `fleet-manager/job-manager.ts` | Manages job lifecycle: creation, queuing, priority, retention, and output streaming. Works with the Runner to track active jobs. See [Job Lifecycle](/architecture/job-system/). |
| **Chat Managers** | `@herdctl/web`, `@herdctl/discord`, `@herdctl/slack` | Dynamically loaded by FleetManager when configured. The web manager serves the dashboard and API; chat managers bridge Discord and Slack to agents. See [Chat Infrastructure](/architecture/chat-infrastructure/), [Discord](/architecture/discord/), [Slack](/architecture/slack/), [Web Dashboard](/architecture/web-dashboard/). |

## Module Composition Pattern

FleetManager uses a **module composition** pattern. Each area of functionality is extracted into a focused class that receives a `FleetManagerContext` interface at construction time:

| Module Class | File | Responsibility |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| `StatusQueries` | `status-queries.ts` | Fleet status, agent info, schedule info queries |
| `ScheduleManagement` | `schedule-management.ts` | Enable/disable schedules, query schedule state |
| `ScheduleExecutor` | `schedule-executor.ts` | Execute triggered schedules via the Runner |
| `JobControl` | `job-control.ts` | Trigger, cancel, and fork jobs |
| `LogStreaming` | `log-streaming.ts` | Async iterable log streams for fleet, job, and agent output |
| `ConfigReload` | `config-reload.ts` | Hot-reload configuration, compute config diffs |

### The FleetManagerContext Interface

Each module class is instantiated once in the FleetManager constructor. Rather than passing individual dependencies to every method call, modules access shared state through the `FleetManagerContext` interface:

```typescript
export interface FleetManagerContext {
  getConfig(): ResolvedConfig | null;
  getStateDir(): string;
  getStateDirInfo(): StateDirectory | null;
  getLogger(): FleetManagerLogger;
  getScheduler(): Scheduler | null;
  getStatus(): FleetManagerStatus;
  getInitializedAt(): string | null;
  getStartedAt(): string | null;
  getStoppedAt(): string | null;
  getLastError(): string | null;
  getCheckInterval(): number;
  emit(event: string, ...args: unknown[]): boolean;
  getEmitter(): EventEmitter;
  getChatManager?(platform: string): IChatManager | undefined;
  getChatManagers?(): Map<string, IChatManager>;
  trigger(agentName: string, scheduleName?: string, options?: TriggerOptions): Promise<TriggerResult>;
}
```

FleetManager implements this interface and passes itself (`this`) to each module. The modules call context getters to access current state, and call `emit()` to fire events. This pattern provides one-way dependency flow (modules depend on context, never on each other) and keeps each module independently testable with a mock context.

### How It Fits Together

```
FleetManager (extends EventEmitter, implements FleetManagerContext)
  ├── StatusQueries(this)      → getFleetStatus(), getAgentInfo(), ...
  ├── ScheduleManagement(this) → getSchedules(), enableSchedule(), ...
  ├── ScheduleExecutor(this)   → executeSchedule()
  ├── JobControl(this)         → trigger(), cancelJob(), forkJob()
  ├── LogStreaming(this)        → streamLogs(), streamJobOutput(), ...
  └── ConfigReload(this)       → reload()
```

FleetManager's public API delegates directly to these modules. For example, `fleet.getFleetStatus()` calls `this.statusQueries.getFleetStatus()`. The public interface remains a single class with a clean API; the implementation is spread across focused files.

## Event System

FleetManager extends Node.js `EventEmitter` and provides strongly-typed events for every lifecycle transition. The event system is what powers real-time updates in the web dashboard, live log streaming in the CLI, and monitoring in library consumers.

### Event Catalog

**Lifecycle events:**

| Event | Payload | When Emitted |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `initialized` | (none) | Config loaded, state directory ready |
| `started` | (none) | Scheduler running, schedules being monitored |
| `stopped` | (none) | All jobs completed or timed out, scheduler stopped |
| `error` | `Error` | Unhandled error not tied to a specific job |

**Configuration events:**

| Event | Payload | When Emitted |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `config:reloaded` | `{ agentCount, agentNames, configPath, changes[], timestamp }` | Configuration hot-reloaded from disk |

**Agent events:**

| Event | Payload | When Emitted |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `agent:started` | `{ agent, timestamp }` | Agent registered with the fleet |
| `agent:stopped` | `{ agentName, timestamp, reason? }` | Agent unregistered from the fleet |

**Schedule events:**

| Event | Payload | When Emitted |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `schedule:triggered` | `{ agentName, scheduleName, schedule, timestamp }` | Schedule fires, before job creation |
| `schedule:skipped` | `{ agentName, scheduleName, reason, timestamp }` | Schedule check skipped (already running, disabled, concurrency limit, empty work source) |

**Job events:**

| Event | Payload | When Emitted |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `job:created` | `{ job, agentName, scheduleName?, timestamp }` | New job created (status: pending) |
| `job:output` | `{ jobId, agentName, output, outputType, timestamp }` | Job produces output during execution |
| `job:completed` | `{ job, agentName, exitReason, durationSeconds, timestamp }` | Job finishes successfully |
| `job:failed` | `{ job, agentName, error, exitReason, durationSeconds?, timestamp }` | Job fails with error |
| `job:cancelled` | `{ job, agentName, terminationType, durationSeconds?, timestamp }` | Job cancelled (graceful, forced, or already stopped) |
| `job:forked` | `{ job, originalJob, agentName, timestamp }` | New job created by forking an existing job's session |

### Event Consumers

- **Web dashboard**: Subscribes to all events via SSE/WebSocket to update the UI in real time.
- **CLI**: Subscribes to `job:output` for live log streaming during `herdctl logs --follow`.
- **Library consumers**: Subscribe to any event for custom monitoring, alerting, or integration.
- **Chat managers**: Subscribe to job events to stream agent responses back to Discord/Slack channels.

## Initialization Flow

When a consumer calls `initialize()` followed by `start()`, the following sequence occurs:

1. **Load configuration** -- ConfigLoader discovers and parses `herdctl.yaml`, loads all agent configs, resolves fleet composition (sub-fleets), merges defaults, and returns a `ResolvedConfig`.
2. **Initialize state directory** -- StateManager creates the `.herdctl/` directory structure if it does not exist, including subdirectories for jobs and sessions.
3. **Create Scheduler** -- A new Scheduler instance is created with agent definitions and a trigger callback that routes back into FleetManager.
4. **Load chat managers** -- FleetManager dynamically imports `@herdctl/discord`, `@herdctl/slack`, and `@herdctl/web` if agents or fleet config reference them. This avoids hard dependencies on optional packages.
5. **Start scheduler** -- On `start()`, the Scheduler begins its polling loop, checking all agent schedules on each tick.

The FleetManager tracks its own lifecycle through a state machine: `uninitialized` -> `initialized` -> `running` -> `stopping` -> `stopped`. Operations that require a specific state (e.g., `trigger()` requires `running`) throw `InvalidStateError` if called at the wrong time.

## Runtime Flow

Once started, the system follows a continuous loop:

1. **Scheduler polls** -- On each tick (default: every 1 second), the Scheduler checks every agent's schedules against their state (last run time, concurrency limits, enabled/disabled status).
2. **Schedule fires** -- When a schedule is due, the Scheduler calls FleetManager's trigger callback with agent and schedule information. FleetManager emits `schedule:triggered`.
3. **Job created** -- FleetManager creates a job record via JobManager and StateManager. The job starts in `pending` status. FleetManager emits `job:created`.
4. **Runner executes** -- The ScheduleExecutor hands the job to the Runner. The Runner transforms agent config via the SDK adapter, selects a runtime (SDK, CLI, or Docker), invokes the agent, and streams messages back as they arrive.
5. **Output persisted** -- Each message is appended to the job's JSONL file and emitted as a `job:output` event. Consumers (web dashboard, CLI, library code) receive output in real time.
6. **Job completes** -- The Runner reports completion or failure. StateManager updates `state.yaml` with the agent's last run time and next trigger time. FleetManager emits `job:completed` or `job:failed`.

This loop continues until `stop()` is called, at which point the Scheduler stops polling, running jobs optionally drain (with a configurable timeout), and the `stopped` event is emitted.

## Agent Composition

Agents in herdctl are defined declaratively in YAML and resolved into `ResolvedAgent` objects at configuration time. Each agent specifies its system prompt, schedules, permissions, MCP servers, and optional chat configuration.

![Agent composition diagram showing how agent YAML config resolves into a ResolvedAgent with schedules, permissions, MCP servers, and chat configuration](/diagrams/agent-composition.svg)

For details on agent configuration, see [Configuration System](/architecture/configuration/). For details on how agents are executed, see [Agent Execution Engine](/architecture/runner/).

## Error Handling

FleetManager defines a typed error hierarchy rooted at `FleetManagerError`. All errors include a `code` string for programmatic discrimination and contextual information for debugging:

| Error Class | Code | When Thrown |
|------------|------|------------|
| `ConfigurationError` | `CONFIGURATION_ERROR` | Config loading or validation failed |
| `AgentNotFoundError` | `AGENT_NOT_FOUND` | Referenced agent does not exist in config |
| `JobNotFoundError` | `JOB_NOT_FOUND` | Referenced job ID does not exist |
| `ScheduleNotFoundError` | `SCHEDULE_NOT_FOUND` | Referenced schedule does not exist on the agent |
| `InvalidStateError` | `INVALID_STATE` | Operation called in wrong lifecycle state |
| `ConcurrencyLimitError` | `CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` | Agent or fleet-wide concurrency limit reached |

All errors extend `FleetManagerError`, which itself extends `Error`. TypeScript consumers can use `instanceof` checks or the `code` property for error discrimination.
