description: Claude execution context and session management
---

A **Session** represents a Claude Code execution context. Sessions manage conversation history, context persistence, and enable resume and fork capabilities across job executions. Understanding session management is essential for controlling how your agents maintain (or reset) their context over time.

## What is a Session?

When Claude Code executes, it maintains a conversation context—the accumulated history of messages, tool uses, and responses. A session encapsulates this context, allowing herdctl to:

- **Persist context** across multiple job executions
- **Resume** interrupted work from exactly where it left off
- **Fork** existing sessions to explore alternative approaches
- **Isolate** conversations per channel in chat integrations

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User/Schedule
  participant A as Agent
  participant T as Tools

  Note over U,T: SESSION: Claude's accumulated context

  U->>A: Check for ready issues and implement one
  A->>A: I found issue #42. Reading the spec...
  A->>T: Read src/api/users.ts
  T-->>A: (file contents)
  A->>A: I'll add the validation logic...

  Note over U,T: Metadata: id, agentId, mode, createdAt, lastActiveAt
```

## Session Modes

herdctl supports three session modes that control how context is managed across job executions:

### fresh_per_job

Each job starts with a completely fresh session—no prior context from previous runs.

```yaml
session:
  mode: fresh_per_job
```

**Use cases:**
- Stateless tasks that should start clean each time
- Jobs where prior context might cause confusion
- High-security scenarios requiring context isolation

**Behavior:**
- New session created for every job execution
- No conversation history carried forward
- Previous sessions are archived but not used

```
Job 1 → Session A (fresh) → Completed
Job 2 → Session B (fresh) → Completed  # No memory of Job 1
Job 3 → Session C (fresh) → Completed  # No memory of Jobs 1 or 2
```

### persistent

Maintains context across multiple job executions. The agent "remembers" previous work.

```yaml
session:
  mode: persistent
```

**Use cases:**
- Long-running projects requiring continuity
- Agents that build on previous work
- Tasks where context improves performance

**Behavior:**
- Session persists across job executions
- Conversation history accumulates
- Context is automatically summarized when it grows large

```
Job 1 → Session A → Completed (context saved)
Job 2 → Session A → Completed (continues with Job 1's context)
Job 3 → Session A → Completed (continues with Jobs 1+2 context)
```

**Configuration options:**

```yaml
session:
  mode: persistent
  max_context_tokens: 100000   # Summarize when exceeded
  context_window: 50           # Keep last N messages in full detail
```

### per_channel

Creates separate sessions for each communication channel. Ideal for chat integrations where different channels represent different conversations or users.

```yaml
session:
  mode: per_channel
```

**Use cases:**
- Discord/Slack bot integrations
- Multi-user support scenarios
- Channel-specific context isolation

**Behavior:**
- Each channel gets its own persistent session
- Context is isolated between channels
- Sessions are identified by channel ID

```
Discord #general  → Session A (persistent within channel)
Discord #support  → Session B (separate context)
Slack #dev        → Session C (separate context)
```

**Example configuration:**

Each chat-enabled agent has its own Discord bot (created in Discord Developer Portal), appearing as a distinct "person" in chat.

```yaml
name: project-support
description: "Answers questions in Discord channels"
workspace: my-project
repo: owner/my-project

chat:
  discord:
    bot_token_env: SUPPORT_DISCORD_TOKEN  # This agent's own bot
    guilds:
      - id: "guild-id-here"
        channels:
          - id: "123456789"       # #general
            mode: mention
          - id: "987654321"       # #support
            mode: auto

session:
  mode: per_channel           # Separate context per channel
  timeout: 24h                # Session expires after 24h inactivity
```

## Session Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique session identifier |
| `agentId` | string | Agent that owns this session |
| `mode` | enum | Session mode (fresh_per_job, persistent, per_channel) |
| `channelId` | string | Channel ID (for per_channel mode) |
| `status` | enum | Current session status |
| `createdAt` | timestamp | When session was created |
| `lastActiveAt` | timestamp | Last activity timestamp |
| `messageCount` | number | Number of messages in context |
| `tokenEstimate` | number | Estimated context token count |

## Session Lifecycle

Sessions progress through defined states:

```
CREATED → ACTIVE → PAUSED → COMPLETED
                 → EXPIRED
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `created` | Session initialized, not yet used |
| `active` | Claude is currently executing within this session |
| `paused` | Session suspended, ready for resume |
| `completed` | Session finished successfully |
| `expired` | Session timed out due to inactivity |

## Resume Capability

Sessions store Claude's conversation context, enabling powerful recovery scenarios:

### Automatic Resume

When a job is interrupted (network issues, system restart), herdctl can automatically resume:

```yaml
session:
  mode: persistent
  auto_resume: true           # Automatically resume interrupted jobs
  resume_timeout: 1h          # Only auto-resume within 1 hour
```

### Manual Resume

Resume an agent's session interactively with Claude Code:

```bash
# Resume the most recent session
herdctl sessions resume

# Resume a specific session by ID (supports partial match)
herdctl sessions resume a166a1e4

# Resume by agent name
herdctl sessions resume bragdoc-coder
```

This launches Claude Code in the agent's workspace with the full conversation history restored, allowing you to continue the work interactively.

### Resume Behavior

When resuming:
1. Full conversation history is restored
2. Claude receives context about the interruption
3. Execution continues from the last known state

```
Original Job:
  Message 1 → Message 2 → Message 3 → [INTERRUPTED]

Resumed Job:
  Message 1 → Message 2 → Message 3 → [System: Resuming...] → Message 4
```

## Fork Capability

Fork an existing session to explore alternative approaches without affecting the original:

```bash
# Fork a session at its current state
herdctl session fork <session-id>

# Fork and immediately start a new job
herdctl session fork <session-id> --run --prompt "Try a different approach"

# Fork from a specific point in history
herdctl session fork <session-id> --at-message 5
```

### Fork Use Cases

1. **Experimentation**: Try different solutions without losing progress
2. **A/B Testing**: Compare approaches from the same starting point
3. **Rollback**: Return to a known good state

```
Original Session:
  M1 → M2 → M3 → M4 → M5 (current)
                 ↓
Forked Session:  M4' → M5' (different approach)
```

## Example Configurations

### Stateless Coder Agent

For a coder that should evaluate each issue fresh:

```yaml
name: stateless-coder
description: "Implements features without prior context"
workspace: my-project
repo: owner/my-project

schedules:
  - name: issue-check
    trigger:
      type: interval
      every: 5m
    prompt: "Check for ready issues and implement one."

session:
  mode: fresh_per_job        # Clean slate each run
  timeout: 30m               # Maximum job duration
```

### Persistent Research Agent

For an agent that builds knowledge over time:

```yaml
name: research-agent
description: "Builds understanding of the codebase over time"
workspace: my-project
repo: owner/my-project

schedules:
  - name: daily-analysis
    trigger:
      type: cron
      cron: "0 9 * * *"
    prompt: |
      Continue your codebase analysis. Review what you learned yesterday
      and explore new areas. Update your findings in research-notes.md.

session:
  mode: persistent           # Remember previous sessions
  max_context_tokens: 150000 # Allow large context
  context_window: 100        # Keep last 100 messages in detail
```

### Multi-Channel Support Bot

For a support agent handling multiple chat channels (each agent has its own Discord bot):

```yaml
name: support-bot
description: "Answers questions across Discord channels"
workspace: my-project
repo: owner/my-project

chat:
  discord:
    bot_token_env: SUPPORT_DISCORD_TOKEN  # This agent's own bot
    guilds:
      - id: "guild-id-here"
        channels:
          - id: "111222333"
            mode: mention
          - id: "444555666"
            mode: auto

session:
  mode: per_channel          # Isolated context per channel
  timeout: 24h               # Sessions expire after 24h
  idle_timeout: 2h           # Or 2h of inactivity
```

### Hybrid Configuration

Combine session settings with agent-level defaults:

```yaml
name: hybrid-agent
description: "Different session behavior per schedule"
workspace: my-project
repo: owner/my-project

# Default session settings for this agent
session:
  mode: persistent
  timeout: 1h

schedules:
  - name: continuous-work
    trigger:
      type: interval
      every: 30m
    prompt: "Continue working on the current feature."
    # Uses default persistent session

  - name: fresh-review
    trigger:
      type: cron
      cron: "0 9 * * 1"  # Monday mornings
    prompt: "Review the codebase with fresh eyes."
    session:
      mode: fresh_per_job      # Override: start fresh for reviews
```

## Session Storage

Session storage location varies by runtime and execution environment:

### Storage Locations by Mode

| Runtime | Environment | Storage Location | Notes |
|---------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| **Both** | Local | `~/.claude/projects/` | Claude stores sessions; herdctl tracks metadata in `.herdctl/sessions/` |
| **Both** | Docker | `.herdctl/docker-sessions/` | Isolated from local sessions |

**Key behaviors:**
- **Local SDK ↔ CLI**: Sessions compatible (both use Claude Code session system)
- **Docker SDK ↔ CLI**: Sessions compatible (both use Docker mount)
- **Local ↔ Docker**: Sessions NOT compatible (different storage locations)

### Session Compatibility

Sessions persist when switching runtimes **within the same environment**:

```yaml
# Local environment - sessions resume
runtime: sdk    # Job 1
runtime: cli    # Job 2 resumes Job 1's session

# Enable Docker - new session starts
docker:
  enabled: true
runtime: sdk    # Job 3 - fresh session (Docker isolation)
runtime: cli    # Job 4 resumes Job 3's session (both in Docker)
```

:::tip[Environment Isolation]
Docker and local sessions are isolated by design. This prevents path conflicts and maintains container security. If you need to switch between Docker and local execution, expect sessions to start fresh.
:::

### Session File Structure

herdctl stores session metadata for tracking and management:

```
~/.herdctl/
└── sessions/
    ├── agent-name.json           # Session info per agent
    └── ...

~/.herdctl/
└── docker-sessions/              # Docker container sessions
    └── (mounted to containers)
```

Example session metadata:

```json
{
  "session_id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-123456789abc",
  "agent_name": "bragdoc-coder",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z",
  "last_used_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "working_directory": "/Users/you/projects/myapp"
}
```

## Session Commands

List and resume Claude Code sessions from the command line:

```bash
# List all sessions
herdctl sessions

# Filter by agent
herdctl sessions --agent bragdoc-coder

# Show full resume commands
herdctl sessions --verbose

# JSON output for scripting
herdctl sessions --json

# Resume the most recent session in Claude Code
herdctl sessions resume

# Resume a specific session (supports partial ID match)
herdctl sessions resume a166a1e4

# Resume by agent name
herdctl sessions resume bragdoc-coder
```

The `sessions resume` command launches Claude Code with `--resume <session-id>` in the agent's configured workspace directory, making it easy to pick up where a Discord bot or scheduled agent left off.

See the [CLI Reference](/cli-reference/#sessions) for complete command options.
