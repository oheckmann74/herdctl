## 🎯 Top Security Priorities

### 1. Understand the Trust Model
herdctl operates on a **two-tier trust model**:

- **Fleet Operators (HIGH TRUST):** Control fleet.yaml, can use advanced features like `host_config`, shell hooks, volume mounts
- **Agent Configs (MEDIUM TRUST):** Restricted to safe Docker options, cannot escalate privileges
- **External Input (LOW TRUST):** Work items, environment variables - validated before use

**Key Insight:** herdctl trusts fleet operators. If you control fleet.yaml, you control the system.

### 2. Secure Your Configuration Files
- Set restrictive file permissions: `chmod 600 fleet.yaml`
- Store in version control with access controls
- Review changes carefully before applying
- Never commit secrets to config files (use environment variables)

### 3. Use Docker Security Features Wisely
- **Default hardening is strong:** `no-new-privileges`, `CapDrop: ALL`
- **Be cautious with overrides:** `host_config` can weaken security
- **Minimize volume mounts:** Avoid mounting sensitive host paths
- **Use read-only workspaces:** `workspace_mode: ro` when possible

## 🚨 Known Risks

### Accepted by Design

These are **intentional features** with security implications:

1. **Shell Hooks** - Arbitrary command execution via config
   - **Why:** Flexibility for custom integrations
   - **Mitigation:** Only configurable at fleet/agent level (not runtime)

2. **host_config Passthrough** - Can override Docker security defaults
   - **Why:** Advanced Docker configuration needs
   - **Mitigation:** Fleet-level only, well-documented

3. **Network Access** - Agents have internet access by default
   - **Why:** Required for Claude API communication
   - **Note:** `network: none` breaks agent functionality

4. **Prompt Injection** - No content validation on prompts
   - **Why:** Prompts are free-form by nature
   - **Mitigation:** Relies on Claude's injection defenses

### Improvement Areas

1. **No persistent audit log** - Only ephemeral console logs
2. **No secret rotation** - API keys are static environment variables
3. **No state file integrity checks** - Files can be tampered with
4. **No automated dependency scanning** - Manual `npm audit` only

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Fleet Operators

1. **Secure your fleet.yaml:**
   ```bash
   chmod 600 fleet.yaml
   chown $USER:$USER fleet.yaml
   ```

2. **Use environment variables for secrets:**
   ```yaml
   docker:
     env:
       ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"  # Not hardcoded!
   ```

3. **Minimize volume mounts:**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ Dangerous
   volumes:
     - "/:/host:rw"

   # ✅ Safe
   volumes:
     - "/home/user/project:/workspace:ro"
   ```

4. **Review hook commands carefully:**
   ```yaml
   hooks:
     after_run:
       - type: shell
         command: "notify-send 'Job complete'"  # Simple, auditable
   ```

5. **Use read-only workspaces when possible:**
   ```yaml
   docker:
     workspace_mode: ro  # Agent can read but not modify files
   ```

### For Agent Configurations

1. **Restrict permissions:**
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     mode: default  # Requires approval for sensitive operations
   ```

2. **Limit resource usage:**
   ```yaml
   docker:
     memory: "1g"
     pids_limit: 100
     cpu_quota: 50000
   ```

3. **Use minimal Docker images:**
   ```yaml
   docker:
     image: "herdctl/runtime:minimal"
   ```

## 📝 Reporting Security Issues

**Found a security vulnerability?**

1. **Do NOT open a public GitHub issue**
2. Email security concerns to: [maintainer email - TBD]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
