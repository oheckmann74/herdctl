## Update Protocol

### At Update Start
1. Read this file to get `last_checked_commit` from frontmatter
2. Run `git log --oneline <last_checked_commit>..origin/main` to find new commits
3. Check `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` for new version entries since last run
4. If no new commits, update `last_run` timestamp and exit early

### At Update End
1. Update `last_checked_commit` to the latest commit on main that was analyzed
2. Update `last_run` with ISO timestamp
3. Update `entries_added` with count from this run
4. If a branch was created, append to `branches_created`
5. Update `status` to `completed` or `error`
6. Add entry to Run History table
